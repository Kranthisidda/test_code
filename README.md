The project implements a simple password manager application with the following functionalities:

1. Secure Password Storage:

Users can enter account names, usernames, and passwords.
Passwords are encrypted before being stored in a MySQL database table named "passwords". This helps protect passwords in case of a database breach.

2. Password Retrieval:

Users can retrieve passwords based on account name and username.
The retrieved password is decrypted using the same encryption key before being displayed to the user.

3. Password Generation:

The application offers a feature to generate a random, secure password for users. This helps users create strong passwords that are difficult to guess.

4. User Interface:

The code utilizes the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) with labels, entry fields, and buttons. This provides a user-friendly way to interact with the password manager.

5. Encryption Key Management:

The application uses the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm to encrypt and decrypt passwords.
An encryption key is used for this process. The code attempts to load the key from a file named "key.key" on startup.
If the file doesn't exist, a new key is generated and saved to the file.
The key is also saved back to the file before the program exits to ensure it's available for future use.
Important Security Considerations:

While the code encrypts passwords, it's crucial to never hardcode database credentials or the encryption key generation logic in the code. These should be stored securely using environment variables or external configuration files.
Sharing the complete code, especially with database connection details and key generation, poses significant security risks. It's recommended to keep this code private or implement stricter access controls if shared.
